# This course

- Instructors: Andy Eggers and Molly Offer-Westort
- TA: Oscar Cuadros
- part of a sequence:
  - Intro to Quant Soc Sci **(this course)** (fall)
  - Causal Inference (winter)
  - Linear Models (spring)

---


# Big picture: the research process vs methods training 

1. **Data collection**: run survey, enter data from archive, etc
1. **Data processing (programming)**: merge, recode, reshape, aggregate, etc
1. **Data analysis**: visualization, model fitting, statistical inference, etc 
1. **Oh and don't forget**: thinking, reading, writing, etc

--

Compared to typical intro stats courses, we will do: 

- more on visualization
- more on programming 
- more using those tools to learn other concepts


???

Typical stats sequences basically deal with model fitting and hyp testing only. But you spend ~ 90% of time on 1 and 2, and visualization is very important. So we're redressing this somewhat.

---

# Our plan (overview)

- "Data science" first (weeks 1-2, every lab and homework)
  - visualization on "tidied" data
  - learn to "tidy" our data
- Probability/stats essentials (week 3)
- Research design essentials: causality and experiments (week 4)
- Regression (weeks 5 & 6) 
- Inference (weeks 7 & 8)


???

Foregrounding "data science" skills, causality.

# Expectations about background

Useful (but not required) to have some exposure to 

- programming
- probability & statistics
- econometrics/regression modeling

--

If *lots* of this background, maybe you're in the wrong course!


---

# Programming in `R` 

Which one is you? 

1. Never done any programming
1. Did some programming in another language (e.g. Python, Stata)
1. Some experience programming in `R`
1. Experienced at programming in `R`

--

All welcome, but plan your work accordingly.

---

# Expectations for the course 

- Prepare for class
- Participate (ask and answer questions)
- Speak up if you are confused

???

Participation will be both in class as well as on our StackOverflow Q&A platform

---

# Getting and giving help

You will get stuck.

1. Use google.
1. If you're still stuck, ask your question on our private StackOverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/c/uchicagopolmeth)
1. Or if you're brave, ask on the real StackOverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/) if it's about `R` or CrossValidated (https://stats.stackexchange.com/) if it's about stats. 

Please also *answer* questions on our private StackOverflow.

--

If you need to email one of us, please email both of us.

# What we do with data

We'll get started on working with data, and we'll also get started on thinking critically about how you use data to answer questions.

What data would you need to make the argument in the article below?

---

# Inferential questions


- What can the data you *do* have tell you about data you *don't* have?
- What data would you need to answer questions about *what would have happened*?
- What can we say about our *uncertainty* about estimates or predictions?

---

# Assessment 

- 60% problem sets (8 in all)
- 30% independent data analysis project
- 10% class participation

???

Brief overview of data analysis project

# Assignment for Thursday (1): 

### Learning

Attempt online RStudio primers 1.1 and 1.2: 
  - "Data visualization basics" (https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1.1)
  - "Programming basics" (https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1.2)

--

To note: 

- For beginners: primers are not really sequential, so do 1.2 even if you are lost in 1.1
- For non-beginners: if these are too basic, work on "R For Data Science" (R4DS) (including exercises)
- For experienced R programmers: if R4DS too easy for you, let's talk

---

# Assignment for Thursday (2): 

### Technical setup

On your own machine, 
1. install R from https://cran.rstudio.com/ 
1. Install RStudio from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
1. In RStudio, create an RMarkdown document, save it, and click "Knit". 

Did it work? 
- if so, <span class="yellow">great</span>! You are ready to work on your own machine.
- if not, use (free) RStudio Cloud until you resolve the issue.

## In class: some basics about R, RStudio, and RMarkdown.
