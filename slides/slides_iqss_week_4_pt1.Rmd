- For populations, 

  +  we've talked about some ways to describe them (PMF/CDF of marginal, joint, conditional distributions)
  +  and some ways to summarize them (mean, variance, covariance, correlation)

--

- Next week, will talk about some corresponding ways to summarize data sets (sample mean, sample variance, etc.)

--
[Estimation!]

But how are these things related?

---

## Identification

--

- *Parameters* describe features of distributions

--

- We call a parameter of a distribution *identifiable* if in the case that we had **infinite data**, we could approximate the true parameter value to arbitrary precision. 

--

  - e.g., if you have **infinite data** randomly sampled from a distribution, by taking the empirical mean, you get the mean of that distribution with arbitrary precision. 

--

  - in the same scenario, by taking the empirical cdf, you can fully describe the entire distribution with arbitrary precision. 

--

- If we're dealing with a **finite population**, we can think about identifying a target quantity about that population, as if we were to repeat the procedure through we observed data about that population, averaging *across repetitions*, we could approximate the true quantity to arbitrary precision. 

---

For example, suppose we are interested in the components of $Y$, the income of the members of University of Chicago's board of trustees. Income is composed of two elements, annual salary, $X_1$, and annual returns on investments, $X_2$. 



$$
Y\_i = X\_{[i]1}  +  X\_{[i]2}
$$

--

We know everyone's income. We only know breakdown of salary and returns on investments for board members with an annual salary over $500,000.

## Inference

- The practice of *inferring* something about a population/distribution from observable data. 

---
## Inference

- What is *descriptive inference*?

--

- What is *causal inference*?

---

## Elements of descriptive/causal inference [Holland]

-  Define a population of interest. $U$

--

- Determine a variable that is defined over this population, for which there is variation. $A$

--

- Define response variable "of interest." $Y$ 

--

We can consider how $A$ and $Y$ vary together. Without further assumptions, this is just correlation. 


---

What does it mean for something to cause something else?

---
## No causation without manipulation [Holland]


- Causes are only things that could (hypothetically) be treatments in experiments. 

--

 - NOT attributesâ€”e.g., race and biological sex can't plausibly be manipulated, because there is no meaningful *counterfactual*. 

--

- What we can manipulate: others' *perception* of race/sex 
<!-- \citep{bertrand2004emily}  -->

--

- To the extent that sex/gender are social constructs, can we consider counterfactual socialization?



---

## Fundamental problem of causal inference


- We only see the response variable under one version of treatment.

--

- Why does this matter?

---

## Resolution (?) of the fundamental problem of causal inference

- Causal inference is not impossible. 

--

- But making causal inferences without making assumptions IS impossible.

--

- So we need to depend on some assumptions. 

--

- The crux: how plausible are these assumptions?


---
## Some notation for joint relationships


- Correlation: $X$ and $Y$ are correlated. E.g., $\uparrow$ age and $\uparrow$ income. 

--

- Causation: $X$ *moves* $Y$. E.g., when I fertilize the plants, I get a higher yield. 

  +  Implies a *counterfactual*. 

--

 +  If I **hadn't** moved $X$, we would see a different outcome for $Y$. 

--

 +  Holland (1986): "No causation without manipulation."


---

## Joint relationships: notation


-  Dependent variable: ( $Y$ ), the thing we want to study variation in; also "outcome," "response." 

--

- Independent variable: ( $X$ ) in causal settings, the thing that we manipulate. Also "treatment." In non-causal settings, something that may have some natural variation in the population associated with the dependent variable. 

---

## Potential outcomes: notation

Assume $X$ is binary. 



$$
Y_i = \begin{cases}
Y_i(0) & X_i = 0 \\\
Y_i(1) & X_i = 1 \\\
\end{cases}
$$

--

We observe a $Y_i$ for every observation, but only one of $\{Y_i(0), Y_i(1)\}$. 

--

Why is $\textrm{E}[Y_i(0)]$ different from $\textrm{E}[Y_i|X = 0]$? 

--

What is the expectation *over*? 
--
Role of conditional and joint distributions is key in identification. 


---
## Individual treatment effect

$$
\tau_i = Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)
$$ 

--

We're interested in the treatment effect, the difference in potential outcomes had we applied treatment $X$, vs. if we had not. 

--


- What we can't see: $\tau_i$

--

- Fundamental problem of causal inference: we can't see *both* potential outcomes for a given unit *at the same time*. 

--

- Holland (1986)'s assumptions: some structure we can impose on the data to back out counterfactuals. (We usually don't know if assumptions are true.) 

--

- Experiments use the independence assumption...
--
this one we have some more control over. 

<!-- --- -->

<!-- ## The special role of experiments -->


<!--  - In experiments, treatment is randomly assigned by the researcher. -->

<!-- -- -->

<!--  - So we know independence holds by design. -->

<!-- -- -->

<!--  - We can compare groups and get the *average* causal effect.  -->

<!-- -- -->

<!--  - (When can we also get the *individual* causal effect?)  -->

---

## Independence


- Units that receive treatment look, on average, like units that do not.

--

- In experiments, we assign treatment *randomly*, so we know that there is no inherent difference between subjects that *could have* received treatment and *could have* received controlâ€”all subjects *could have* received all versions of treatment, hypothetically. 
--
(The subjunctive mood of research design ...)

--

- Why is this so special? 

--

- What this give us: *identification* of the expected potential outcome  
$$\textrm{E}[Y_i | X_i = 1] = \textrm{E}[Y_i(1)]$$ 

--

- From this, we can identify the average treatment effect:
$$
\tau = \textrm{E}[Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)]
$$

---

- What assumptions would allow us to identify  *individual* causal effects?
